================

A collection of JavaScript utility classes and functions that I've been porting around for years. Includes basic math functions, a seeded random number generator, perlin and simplex noise implementations in up to three dimensions, URL query parameter parsing, and a number of other utilities that bear no relationship to one another.

A lot of this library was an effort to teach myself ES6 syntax and is subject to breaking changes. I wouldn't recommend using it.
